## BatikHub
BatikHub is an application designed to classify various types of batik motifs based on user input. This application not only functions as a classification tool, but also as an educational tool regarding the history and meaning behind each identified batik motif. The results of the motif prediction will be stored in the history page, making it easier for users to access and learn about previously explored batik motifs.

## Background

Indonesian batik, with its rich historical, aesthetic, and philosophical values, represents a significant aspect of the country's cultural heritage. Research conducted by Bandung Fe Institute and Sobat Budaya in 2015 unveiled an extensive array of batik motifs, totaling approximately 5,849 distinct patterns, each carrying its own narrative. However, despite this abundance, only about 10% of these motifs are widely recognized and appreciated. Consequently, many of batik's unique forms and styles remain obscure to the wider populace.

Therefore, we conclude a research question which is how to utilize image classification technology in a mobile application to introduce and enhance the understanding of Indonesian culture such as batik among the younger generation? In response to this inquiry, our team is deeply dedicated and firmly believes that by harnessing appropriate technology, we can devise an innovative and impactful solution to deepen the appreciation and comprehension of Indonesian batik. Through the development of a mobile application utilizing image classification, our objective is to furnish users with an engaging and educational platform, facilitating heightened affinity for and understanding of Indonesian batik.
