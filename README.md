# BatikHub

BatikHub is an application designed to classify various types of batik motifs based on user input. This application not only functions as a classification tool, but also as an educational tool regarding the history and meaning behind each identified batik motif. The results of the motif prediction will be stored in the history page, making it easier for users to access and learn about previously explored batik motifs.
